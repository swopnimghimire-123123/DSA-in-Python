        "\n",
        "Linear search, also known as sequential search, is a simple algorithm for finding an element within a list. It sequentially checks each element of the list until a match is found or the whole list has been searched.\n",
        "\n",
        "**How it works:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Start at the beginning of the list.\n",
        "2. Compare the target element with the current element in the list.\n",
        "3. If the elements match, the search is successful, and the index of the element is returned.\n",
        "4. If the elements do not match, move to the next element in the list.\n",
        "5. Repeat steps 2-4 until a match is found or the end of the list is reached.\n",
        "6. If the end of the list is reached without finding a match, the search is unsuccessful.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Advantages:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Simple to implement.\n",
        "* Works on unsorted lists.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Disadvantages:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Can be slow for large lists, as it may require checking every element.\n",
        "* Not efficient for sorted lists (binary search is better for sorted lists).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's say we have the following list: `[4, 2, 7, 1, 9]` and we want to find the element `7`.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Start at the first element, `4`. Does `4` equal `7`? No.\n",
        "2. Move to the next element, `2`. Does `2` equal `7`? No.\n",
        "3. Move to the next element, `7`. Does `7` equal `7`? Yes!\n",
        "4. The element `7` is found at index 2. The search is successful."
